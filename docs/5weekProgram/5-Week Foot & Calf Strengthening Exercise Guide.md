## Form Tips & Safety Notes

- **Start slowly**: Begin with shorter holds and fewer reps
- **Quality over quantity**: Perfect form prevents injury
- **Listen to your body**: Some discomfort is normal, sharp pain is not
- **Progress gradually**: Don't rush to advanced exercises
- **Stay consistent**: Daily routine is more important than intensity
- **Warm up**: Always do ankle circles before strengthening exercises
- **Cool down**: Always stretch after strengthening exercises

## Modifications for Beginners

- Use wall or chair for balance on all standing exercises
- Reduce repetitions by half if exercises feel too challenging
- Hold stretches for 15 seconds instead of 30 if very tight
- Take rest days if experiencing unusual soreness
- Focus on form over speed or repetitions

## When to Progress

- Move to next week when current exercises feel comfortable
- You should be able to complete all sets and reps with good form
- Mild muscle fatigue is normal, joint pain is not
- If an exercise becomes easy, it's time to progress
