# Strengthening weak legs for sedentary people

Your description suggests several interconnected issues common in sedentary workers: weak posterior chain muscles (calves, glutes, hamstrings), tight fascia, and poor lower leg endurance. The burning Achilles pain and plantar fasciitis symptoms indicate both weakness and tightness in your lower legs.

Here's a progressive program to address these issues:

## Daily Routine (10-15 minutes)

**Morning Activation:**

- Calf raises: 3 sets of 15-20 (progress to single-leg versions)
- Toe walks: 30 seconds forward, 30 seconds backward
- Heel walks: 30 seconds (walking on heels only)
- Ankle circles: 10 each direction, both feet

**Evening Recovery:**

- Calf stretches: Hold 30 seconds each leg (straight leg and bent knee versions)
- Plantar fascia stretch: Pull toes back toward shin, hold 30 seconds
- Tennis ball roll: Roll under each foot for 1-2 minutes
- Achilles stretches: Wall push-ups, hold 30 seconds each leg

## Strengthening Program (3x per week)

**Week 1-2:**

- Seated calf raises: 3 sets of 15-20
- Towel scrunches: Pick up towel with toes, 15 reps each foot
- Resistance band dorsiflexion: 3 sets of 15 (pull toes toward shin)
- Single-leg glute bridges: 3 sets of 10 each leg

**Week 3-4:**

- Standing calf raises: 3 sets of 15-20
- Single-leg calf raises (assisted): 3 sets of 5-8 each leg
- Heel-to-toe walking: 20 steps forward and backward
- Wall sits: 3 sets of 30-45 seconds

**Week 5+:**

- Single-leg calf raises (unassisted): 3 sets of 8-12 each leg
- Jump rope or calf raise jumps: 3 sets of 30 seconds
- Single-leg deadlifts: 3 sets of 8-10 each leg
- Farmer's walks: 3 sets of 30-40 steps

## Progressive Standing/Walking Protocol

Start with your current tolerance and add 2-3 minutes weekly:

- Week 1: Stand 5 minutes, walk 0.25 miles
- Week 2: Stand 8 minutes, walk 0.4 miles
- Week 3: Stand 12 minutes, walk 0.6 miles
- Continue progressing gradually

## Immediate Relief Strategies

- Ice massage for Achilles after activity (5-10 minutes)
- Supportive shoes with good arch support
- Consider heel cups or arch supports temporarily
- Elevate feet when sitting for long periods

## Workplace Modifications

- Set hourly reminders to stand and do calf raises
- Use a standing desk converter for 15-30 minutes at a time
- Keep a tennis ball under your desk for foot rolls
- Do ankle pumps while coding

The key is consistent daily movement and gradual progression. Your existing strength base is good, so focus on endurance and addressing the specific weaknesses in your feet and calves. If pain persists or worsens after 4-6 weeks, consider seeing a physical therapist for personalized assessment.

Start with the daily routine immediately, and begin the strengthening program at a comfortable level. The burning Achilles pain should improve as you build strength and flexibility in your calves.
